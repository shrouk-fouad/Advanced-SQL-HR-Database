# Advanced-SQL-HR-Dataset
This project is about HR dataset for a company. <br> This Dataset is from the HR Department for all Employees of the company even the ones that left(Attrition). The data collection started from 2012 until 2022. Our quest was to build a database for this company that can be used for the following business needs.

1. There are plenty of details to have about the Employee: Their ID, Name, Gender, Age, Department in which they work, Their hiredate, their Salary, Job role, Whether they work overtime or not, whether they travel for business or not, and whether they are still in the company or left. 
2. We also need to keep the educational background of each employee, their educational level and the field of said education. 
3. We also need to keep track of the employeeâ€™s history like when was their last promotion, how many years have they worked for the company, how many years have they worked with the same manager, and how many years have they spent in their current role. 
4. We also need to keep track of how many departments we have and what they are. 
5. Annually, each employee gets to have a review with the HR and their direct manager, during this review the employee fills out a survey where they give a satisfaction rate 1-5 for how satisfied they are with their job, the environment, their relationships with colleagues and their work-life balance. They also give themselves a rate 1-5 for how they feel their performance was in the previous year. While their managers also give a rating 1-5 for the employees performance in the previous year.
